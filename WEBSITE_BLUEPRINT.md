### 2. BIO PAGE

**Headline:** The Maker Behind the Mission

**Body Text:**

I am a fully self-taught, multi-disciplinary artist and set builder with a "problem-solver" DNA. With over five years of experience as an Art Director—leading world-class immersive builds like the Mayan Temple and the Time Machine—I specialize in turning high-concept visions into physical reality.

My hands-on expertise spans power carving (from hand tools to power carving), advanced epoxy resin work, mould making, and traditional woodworking. I believe that professional artistry doesn't require a high-waste budget; it requires a resourceful eye. Whether I'm building a set for a film or a bespoke sculpture for a private client, my work is rooted in the art of the reclaim. I can turn my hand to pretty much anything creatively.

### 3. MISSION STATEMENT PAGE

**Headline:** Our Vision: Circularity in Creativity

**The Core Message:**
> "Transforming the temporary into the permanent. We bridge the gap between industrial production waste and community creativity by providing a circular home for professional-grade props, sets, and materials."

**What We Are Achieving (The Three Pillars):**

1. **The Prop House:** Providing Film, TV, and Media with a sustainable hire library of high-spec builds, offering a green alternative to single-use sets.

2. **The Scrap Store:** Making professional-grade materials (timber, textiles, acrylics) accessible and affordable for schools, local makers, and DIY enthusiasts.

3. **The Bespoke Studio:** A professional workshop where art direction and fabrication meet 100% resourced materials to create unique, high-end commissions for private and commercial clients.
